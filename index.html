5) Add the egg and mix until fully combined. Then mix in the oil, red food coloring, and vanilla.</br>
6) Mix in the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. </br>
7) Make sure to mix each addition until just combined and be careful not to over mix the batter. </br>
8) Evenly distribute the batter between all 16 cupcake liners in the prepared muffin pans, only filling each one about halfway full.</br>
9) Bake in separate batches at 350째F (177째C) for 15-18 minutes or until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</br>
10) Carefully remove the cupcakes from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</br>
